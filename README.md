A clean, responsive, and accessible task manager application built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Tasks are saved using localStorage.

- **Delete Todos**: Remove tasks you no longer need.
- **Mark as Complete**: Check off tasks as you finish them.
- **Filter Views**: Toggle between All, Active, and Completed tasks.
- **Persistent Storage**: Your todos are saved to LocalStorage, so they aren't lost when you refresh the page.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup for better accessibility.
- **CSS3**: Custom properties (variables), Flexbox, and Grid for layout and styling.
